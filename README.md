# The-SYK-Model-for-a-non-Fermi-liquid

This is a technical report on the SYK model for a non-Fermi liquid. The technical report consists a review of certain pieces of literature and extended study in the context of a
Quantum Many-Body Physics master's level course and it aims on a summary of two main aspects that are:
  i) The theoretical one, by studying a generalization of the model for regarding dynamical quantum phase transition from fast to slow scrambling.
  ii) The experimental one, by simulating the behaviour of the non-Fermi state of the SYK model by means of a highly complex quantum algorithm and quantum simulation.
